# OMP-Open-Modular-PLC
**A modular PLC that might some day be open-source**

The professional world is full of PLC manufacturers. They are doing a great job and you can buy almost anything you can think of. 

The DIY world is full of Arduino-like hardware that is ultra flexible and super-easy to program, but you always end up with a lot of PCBs, soldered together like hell and stuffed into cardboard boxes.

But wouldn't it be nice to have something that combines these two worlds? A PLC in a decent housing that is both modular and easy to program?

We took a shot at this and started our own PLC, based on the seasoned STM32F103 controller family and the great stm32duino project.
